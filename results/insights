Notes:
1.For better accuracy of the data, I remove all the reviews with number of words <4 and >75.
2.For the analysis in the plot and cast parts, there may be errors due to the accuracy of the
prediction model. There may be smaller error in the director part for the labels are made manaully
instead of being predicted by model.However, I don't think this part of data is representitive enough for there're very few people directly mentioning the director.
3.The error in the analysis of Never Say Die may be higher than the other two for it is not included in the training data while the other two are.
4. I don't include the most common words under the neutral part, because I don't think they are representive enough of the audience's attitudes.

Most of the audiencce mentioned that Zack Snyder's ability of story telling is terrible although his visual style is quite impressive, and Joss Whedon's jokes are quite boring. Actually, their style are not very compatible, which makes the film quite messy.

制作预告片的应该换人了
虚假预告

Most common words under each polarity:
Positive: 女侠，超人
Negative:爆米花，漫威，尾灯，扎导，剧情，特效
Almost all the postive parts are about the actors and actress(especially the superman and the wonder woman).
For the negative parts, besides the cirtics about the director mentioned above, the audience also criticizes that the plot is too simple and the vfx is quite dull. They also this film produced by DC is quite Marvel style, which is a standard commercial film, good for entertainment but lacking in depth. It's quite different from the dark style in other DC's films. Some audience are quite disappointed to this.

As a commedy, most of the audience like the film because it's really funny although many of the points are quite cliched. They also compliments the actors and actress of the film.
While for the audience who don't like it, there're too many bugs in the plot and it's more like a comedy skit or stage show rather than a film. Some points are really cliched and out-dated. They also mentioned this film is much worse than another recent commedy film, Goodbye Mr. Loser.
